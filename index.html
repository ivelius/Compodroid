<p>Compodroid is an <a href="https://www.android.com/">Android</a> library that allows you to scatter your code around target specific "components" , rather than writing the code inside the target class itself. Compodroid turns any class into a "set of components" that operate independently allowing hight level of code modularity. Being design specifically with Android in mind , Compodroid has a build in support for all <a href="https://www.android.com/">Android</a> core elements such as : <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html">Activities</a> , <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Fragment.html">Fragments</a> , <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service.html">Services</a> , <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver.html">Broadcast Recievers</a> ,etc... </p>

<a id="why-to-use-compodroid-" class="anchor" href="#why-to-use-compodroid-" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why to use Compodroid ?</h2>

<p>There are 2 common scenarios in which your project can benefit from Compodroid .</p>

<h3>
<a id="complicated-one-screen-app" class="anchor" href="#complicated-one-screen-app" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Complicated One Screen App</h3>

<p>Imagine you have a single screen app , which is contains a ViewPager , a sliding drawer , navigation tabs and deep drill down hierarchy for each pager view screen. While you will try to organize your functionality across one <em>Host</em> Activity and many fragments in it , you will soon realize that there is too much code to put into the <em>Host</em> Activity ,and you will naturally scatter the functionality across different classes that cooperate with your <em>Host</em> Activity . In regards to your fragments , they will probably have a lot of similarities and you will try to reuse code by subclasing a <em>BaseFragment</em> and to put more code into it that actually every subclassing Fragment needs. 
This is an example when Compodroid is naturally improving your code organization. <em>Host</em> Activity can be broken into "Components" where each component will define a "feature" or a functionality. The same is true for fragments. Instead of subclassing a <em>BaseFragment</em> (which is still possible with Compodroid) , you will add components to each fragment that actually needs them . In such a way you will not only reuse your code but will also save a memory by not loading methods of a superclass that you don't actually need.</p>

<h3>
<a id="deep-activitiesfragments-hierarchy" class="anchor" href="#deep-activitiesfragments-hierarchy" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Deep Activities/Fragments Hierarchy</h3>

<p>Imagine you have a BaseFragment that have some common functionality to all of your fragments.You extend it to have a <em>PopupFragment</em> , <em>ToastFragment</em> and a <em>BadgeFragment</em> . Now Both <em>PopupFragment</em> and a <em>ToastFragment</em> can appear with animation. You would like to write your animation code somewhere once and reuse it everywhere where it is needed. But writing the code in the <em>BaseFragment</em> will actually cause a <em>BadgeFragment</em> to also appear with animation. So you decide to extend the base fragment with <em>AbstractAnimatableFragment</em> and use it as a superclass of your <em>PopupFragment</em> and <em>ToastFragment</em>. Well done ! Now what if both <em>ToastFragment</em> and <em>BadgeFragment</em> can auto disappear after 5 seconds. Will you create a subclass of <em>BaseFragment</em> as a <em>DissapearableFragment</em> for a <em>BadgeFragment</em> , and then <em>AnimatableDissapearableFragment</em> and use it for <em>ToastFragment</em> ? You see where it is going right ? Rather than bloating your project with a special subclass for every case , you can just encapsulate your desired functionality in <em>AppearableFragmentComponent</em> and <em>DissapearableFragmentComponent</em>. And attach those to fragments that need it.</p>

<p>Certainly.</p>

<ul>
<li>One of the biggest advantages is modularity of your code. A component done right is a component that can be added or removed at any given time. Hence , you will always have a chance to add or remove functionality on the fly to/from your target. </li>
<li>A component can be <em>multi targeted</em> .Component created for one target can be translated to another target using <a href="https://github.com/ivelius/Compodroid/blob/master/compodroid-lib/src/main/java/com/yan/compodroid/core/CompodroidComponentAdapter.java">ComponentAdapter</a>.That allows you to reuse the same functionality across all of your classes , as long as you can adapt them in a manner that makes sense to you.</li>
<li>Compodroid aims to be community driven. There might be already plug and play solution to your problem that is provided as a <em>Compodroid plugin package</em> . As an example see <a href="https://github.com/ivelius/Compodroid/tree/master/injections-pack">injections-pack</a> .</li>
<li>Fast iteration can be achieved through encapsulating "features" into components. If at some point you decide that you need to remove/disable a feature of your app , simply detach the component from your target. For example the entire flow of Login with Facebook can be encapsulated into a ActivityComponent . When you no longer want this feature , simply detach the component . If you no longer want it ever , you can delete one file of the component and forget this feature ever existed.</li>
</ul>

<a id="compodroid-architecture" class="anchor" href="#compodroid-architecture" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Compodroid Architecture</h2>

<p>Compodroid main idea is to stay simple and thin , while highly scalable.
Basically the entire library is <a href="https://github.com/ivelius/Compodroid/tree/master/compodroid-lib/src/main/java/com/yan/compodroid/core">this</a> simple package. Everything else is just an extension of the core concept.
To make Compodroid <a href="https://www.android.com/">Android</a> friendly ,the main extensions are <a href="https://github.com/ivelius/Compodroid/tree/master/compodroid-lib/src/main/java/com/yan/compodroid/activity">Compodroid Activity</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ivelius/Compodroid/tree/master/compodroid-lib/src/main/java/com/yan/compodroid/fragment">Compodroid Fragment</a> packages. Those extensions are built in into <a href="https://github.com/ivelius/Compodroid/tree/master/compodroid-lib">compodroid-lib</a>.</p>

<h3>
<a id="component-manager" class="anchor" href="#component-manager" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Component Manager</h3>

<p>The Component Manager main purpose is to delegate methods from the class that holds it to the actual components that were added to the Component Manager. Component Manager is created to serve a single instance of a class (reffered as a <em>Target</em>) . All components that are added to the Component Manager , must target the same class as the Component Manager (not necessary the same instance).</p>

<h3>
<a id="component" class="anchor" href="#component" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Component</h3>

<p>Is a peace of logic that can be added to Component Manager. Component will receive events from Component Manager that it is attached to. Amount of events or callback methods will vary depending on the Component Manager .
The Component also have a <em>Target</em> and can be added <strong>only</strong> to Managers that targeting the same <em>Target</em> class as the component.</p>

<a id="how-to-use-compodroid-" class="anchor" href="#how-to-use-compodroid-" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to use Compodroid ?</h2>

<p>Make sure to add <a href="https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter">jcenter</a> as a maven repository to your main build.gradle.
For compodroid lib :</p>

<p><code>compile 'com.yan.compodroid:compodroid-lib:0.0.3-ALPHA'</code></p>

<p>Compodroid plugin packages should be added separatley.
For example <em>injections-pack</em> :</p>

<p><code>compile 'com.yan.compodroid:injections-pack:0.0.2-BETA'</code></p>
